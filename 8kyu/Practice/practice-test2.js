//The male gametes or sperm cells in humans and other mammals are heterogametic and contain one of two types of sex chromosomes. 
//They are either X or Y. The female gametes or eggs however, contain only the X sex chromosome and are homogametic.

//The sperm cell determines the sex of an individual in this case.
//If a sperm cell containing an X chromosome fertilizes an egg, the resulting zygote will be XX or female. 
//If the sperm cell contains a Y chromosome, then the resulting zygote will be XY or male.

//Determine if the sex of the offspring will be male or female based on the X or Y chromosome present in the male's sperm.

//If the sperm contains the X chromosome, return "Congratulations! You're going to have a daughter."; 
//If the sperm contains the Y chromosome, return "Congratulations! You're going to have a son.";

//problem 
//Trolls are attacking your comment section!

//A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.
//Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.
//For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

//Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.
