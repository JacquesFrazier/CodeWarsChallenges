//TEST YOUR MIGHT!!!!

//1
//question 
//Can you find the needle in the haystack?

//Write a function findNeedle() that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle"

//After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says:

//"found the needle at position " plus the index it found the needle, so:

//Example(Input --> Output)

//["hay", "junk", "hay", "hay", "moreJunk", "needle", "randomJunk"] --> "found the needle at position 5" 


//2
//problem
//Write a function to convert a name into initials. This kata strictly takes two words with one space in between them.

//The output should be two capital letters with a dot separating them.

//It should look like this:

//Sam Harris => S.H

//patrick feeney => P.F


//3
//problem 
//Create a function that accepts a string and a single character, 
//and returns an integer of the count of occurrences the 2nd argument is found in the first one.

//If no occurrences can be found, a count of 0 should be returned.

//("Hello", "o")  ==>  1
//("Hello", "l")  ==>  2
//("", "z")       ==>  0
//str_count("Hello", 'o'); // returns 1
//str_count("Hello", 'l'); // returns 2
//str_count("", 'z'); // returns 0


//4
//problem 
//Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
//If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

//The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

//name + " plays banjo" 
//name + " does not play banjo"
//Names given are always valid strings.
